QuasiT
======

Quasi Twitter app.

This app allows a user to post and read "tweets" posted to a site using the free open source tool StatusNet
(http://www.http://status.net).

It is based on a course I took at http://www.marakana.com in 2012. 

This app is a show case of many different aspects in android app programming.
It covers subjects such as:

Async tasks | Fragments | Broadcast recievers | Services and system services | Layouts UI and graphics design | AlarmManagers | 
Security and permissions and many more.

An APK is provided to examine the application. It is currenty best viewed on a 480x800 px device.
On first launch, enter prefrences and use these credentials to log in:

user: CVAccount

password: a12345a

server:  http://yamba.marakana.com/api

Enable GPS location in your device to post using your current location.

Use 'Refresh timeline' under menu to refresh time line manually.

A web site running StatusNet is provided to show your posts under the Student account: http://yamba.marakana.com/

All code and UI was written by me and is maintaied by me.
